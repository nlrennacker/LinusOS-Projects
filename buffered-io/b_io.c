 * File: b_io.c
 *
 * Description: This program functions as a buffered reader for input and output data
 * Its operation involves setting up an array for file control blocks and populating it with files.
 * Then, the software loads and reads the file into the buffer of the file control block.  It then 
 * transfers the data from the fcb buffer into the buffer of the user who called the software.
 * And after everything is completed it closes its resources.
