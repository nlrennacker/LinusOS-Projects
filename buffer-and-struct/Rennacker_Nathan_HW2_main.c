 * Project: Assignment 2 â€“ Stucture in Memory and Buffering
 *
 * File: Rennacker_Nathan_HW2_main.c
 *
 * Description: This assignment's purpose is to work with a structure defined in a header file
 * that contains varied information: from student info (name, ID, gradeLevel, etc), to a message
 * that needs to be populated with information from the command line. Then a series of strings
 * need to be moved from calling getNext() on a char * string to a buffer, which needs to be 
 * committed to a different, unknown data structure while ensuring that the buffer doesn't overflow
 * and we are committing exactly 256 bytes each time (except for the last commit)
 *
